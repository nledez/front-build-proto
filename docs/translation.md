# Add a translation


## Add a language file

1. Get the json file from POEditor.
2. Store it in `src/locales`.
3. Add corresponding entry in the `src/locales/index.js`  file.
4. Add an entry in the profile file at the option level. 
   Be careful, you must use a locale name available in Python Babel or it will 
   break the person entry.


## Add a translation key
