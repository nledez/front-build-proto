## Recommandations

Before coding on Kitsu we recommend to:

* Know the ES6 syntax.
* Read the Vue.js documentation main chapters.
* Understand how Vuex works.

## Code guidelines

* Make your best to keep your lines < 80 chars wide.
* Respect configured ESLint rules.
* Always order object fields in alphabetical order.
* Use Vuex state only when necessary, prefer local state (vuex creates
  performance overhead).
* Always use Vuex actions when doing remote API calls.
